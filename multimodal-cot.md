# Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MM-CoT)

## Overview
A groundbreaking approach that extends chain-of-thought reasoning to multimodal scenarios, achieving SOTA performance with sub-1B parameter models on ScienceQA benchmark.

## Key Innovation
MM-CoT introduces a two-stage framework separating rationale generation from answer inference, enabling more reliable reasoning across text and image inputs while reducing hallucination.

## Technical Implementation
```python
# Example implementation of the two-stage MM-CoT framework
def multimodal_cot(image, question):
    # Stage 1: Rationale Generation
    visual_features = vision_encoder(image)
    text_features = text_encoder(question)
    
    # Combine multimodal features
    multimodal_features = fusion_layer([visual_features, text_features])
    rationale = rationale_generator(multimodal_features)
    
    # Stage 2: Answer Inference
    final_answer = answer_inference(rationale, multimodal_features)
    return rationale, final_answer

# Usage Example
def process_science_qa(image_path, question):
    image = load_image(image_path)
    rationale, answer = multimodal_cot(image, question)
    return {
        'reasoning_chain': rationale,
        'final_answer': answer
    }
