**Paper**: [Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09417)  
**Code**: [GitHub - hustvl/Vim](https://github.com/hustvl/Vim)

### Overview
Vision Mamba (Vim) introduces a revolutionary approach to visual representation learning by replacing traditional transformer architectures with bidirectional state space models. The model processes visual data as sequences with position embeddings, achieving global context understanding without the computational overhead of self-attention mechanisms.

### Key Innovations
- Achieves 2.8× faster processing than DeiT (Vision Transformer)
- Reduces GPU memory usage by 86.8% for high-resolution (1248×1248) image processing
- Maintains competitive performance on ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation

### Technical Implementation
```python
class VisionMambaBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, dim, d_state=16, d_conv=4):
        super().__init__()
        self.dim = dim
        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(dim)
        self.mamba = MambaBlock(
            d_model=dim,
            d_state=d_state,
            d_conv=d_conv,
            expand=2
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        B, H, W, C = x.shape
        x = self.norm(x)
        x = rearrange(x, 'b h w c -> b (h w) c')
        x = self.mamba(x)
        x = rearrange(x, 'b (h w) c -> b h w c', h=H, w=W)
        return x
